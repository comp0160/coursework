# COMP0160 2022/23 Individual Coursework Assignment

## Summary

* Choose a small component of the functionality of a cloud-based media editing app
* Analyse the interface requirements for this functionality
* Explain any perceptual issues that affect accessibility
* Propose and simulate a UX/UI for the functionality
* Explain how your design decisions account for perception and accessibility
* Discuss the effectiveness of these choices

##Â Background

Media creation and editing software is typically complex and perceptually demanding, with detailed user interfaces densely packed with information and lots of fiddly controls. Your new startup, **Fictitious Studios**, aims to make rich media editing available to everyone via its suite of cloud-based apps, **Fictitious CS**. Among the domains targeted by this suite will be:

* podcast production (cf. [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/audition.html), [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/))
* video editing (cf. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/final-cut-pro/), [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/premiere.html))
* 3d modeling (cf. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/))
* music production (cf. [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/), [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/))
* image editing (cf. [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/))
* vector graphics (cf. [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/))
* presentations (cf. [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint/), [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/uk/keynote/))

**You** are the product lead responsible for the UX/UI of one of these apps. Choose a domain with which you are familiar and focus on a small, relatively self-contained piece of functionality. The scope and level of detail are up to you, but bear in mind the limited size of the report.


## Requirements

### Audience
### Perceptual Challenges
### Interface
### Testing
### Discussion

## Constraints

Your app should be designed for deployment to at least one of: web browser, mobile device, desktop computer. You may propose a unified design that works on multiple platforms if you wish.

The design should be implementable with only the widely-available mainstream technology of 2022. You may posit the use of assistive devices such as screen readers and basic voice recognition, but **not** custom hardware or speculative methods such as direct brain interfaces or general AIs that magically "understand" what you want.

Use whatever means you prefer to lay out and trial your design. If you are comfortable with tools such as [wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), feel free to use those. Alternatively, lay your design out in PowerPoint or just sketch it on paper with a sharpie.


## Submission Requirements

Submit your report via [Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=30035&section=1). The submission link will be available from XX Feb 2023. Deadline for submissions is XX March 2023 at XX:XX.

Submit a single document in PDF, RTF or MS Word (`.docx`) format. Your report should consist of **no more than 8 pages of A4**, including figures, tables and references. Body text should be no smaller than 12pt, spaced for easy reading. If you have created an online wireframe, prototype or mockup demonstrating your UI you may include a link to it, but your report should be complete and comprehensible without it.
